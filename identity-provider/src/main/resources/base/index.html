<h1>BISON Identity Provider</h1>
<main>

    <p><b>Did you perhaps take a wrong turn?</b></p>

    <p>This is the identity provider &ndash; where you pick a bison once prompted.<br>
    But nobody seems to have prompted you.</p>
    <p>Are you maybe looking for the grasslands? This place isn't that place, sorry. Maybe start there.</p>
